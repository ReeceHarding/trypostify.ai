# QStash Upgrade Guide for Long-Term Scheduling

## Current Issue
Your QStash account is on the **Free Tier** which limits scheduling to **7 days maximum**. This prevents queueing tweets more than a week in advance.

## Solution: Upgrade to Pay-As-You-Go Plan

### Benefits of QStash PAYG Plan:
- **1 Year Maximum Delay** (vs 7 days on free tier)
- **Pay only for what you use** (no monthly fees)
- **Same API, no code changes needed**
- **Immediate activation**

### How to Upgrade:

1. **Visit QStash Console**: https://console.upstash.com/qstash
2. **Go to Settings/Billing** in your QStash dashboard
3. **Select Pay-As-You-Go Plan**
4. **Add payment method** (credit card)
5. **Activate immediately** - no code changes needed

### Pricing:
- **$0.0001 per message** (extremely affordable)
- **Example**: 1000 scheduled tweets = $0.10 (10 cents)
- **No monthly fees** - pay only when you schedule

### Current Configuration:
Your QStash is already properly configured in `.env.local`:
```
QSTASH_URL=https://qstash.upstash.io
QSTASH_TOKEN=eyJVc2VySUQiOiIyNjlmZmQzNC0yMGYwLTRhMGMtOGNmNi1kOWFlMDYwNWY2M2MiLCJQYXNzd29yZCI6IjBkNDVjMTUwODVmNjRhYTk4YmE1Y2E3YTYwYzlhY2JjIn0=
```

### After Upgrade:
- **Queue tweets months in advance** ✅
- **No 7-day limitation** ✅  
- **All existing functionality preserved** ✅
- **No code changes required** ✅

### Alternative Workaround (if you don't want to upgrade):
Use the **Schedule button** instead of **Queue button** for dates beyond 7 days. The Schedule feature allows manual date/time selection and can work with longer delays.

## Implementation Status

The codebase now:
✅ **Attempts long-term scheduling** (up to 90 days search)
✅ **Provides helpful error messages** when hitting QStash limits
✅ **Suggests upgrade path** in error messages
✅ **Preserves all content and media** during the process

## Next Steps

1. **Upgrade QStash plan** (recommended - takes 2 minutes)
2. **Test long-term scheduling** (will work immediately after upgrade)
3. **Enjoy unlimited scheduling** up to 1 year in advance!

The upgrade is **immediate** and requires **no code changes** - just payment method activation.
