## Icons

**Use Lucide only**: All icons in this project must come from the Lucide icon library (https://lucide.dev).

- Consistent stroke-based design
- 24x24 viewBox with stroke-width="2"
- Use `lucide` and `lucide-{icon-name}` class naming
- Never mix with other icon libraries (Heroicons, Feather, etc.)
